**Stop endless scrolling. Get instant, summarized purchase recommendations tailored to your exact needs, complete with sources.**

## 🌟 Overview

The modern shopping journey is plagued by information overload. Finding the *perfect* product requires sifting through countless reviews, forum discussions, and conflicting specifications.

**Spender Buddy** is designed to cut through the noise. It acts as your personal, highly efficient research assistant. You simply input your specific requirements (e.g., "A lightweight laptop for video editing under $1500 with a battery life over 8 hours"), and the AI searches the vast internet, summarizes the best options that meet *all* criteria, and provides the answer with direct links to the sources it used for verification.

## ✨ Key Features

| **🧠 AI-Powered Synthesis** | The AI reads, analyzes, and synthesizes data from multiple online sources (e.g., tech blogs, e-commerce sites, user reviews) to form a coherent, direct answer. |
| **📄 Summarized & Actionable Answers** | Receive a concise list of recommended products, highlighting how each one meets your criteria, rather than a list of search links. |
| **🔗 Verified Source Citations** | Every piece of information and recommendation is backed by verifiable sources, provided as clickable links so you can check the context and price yourself. |
| **🛍️ Multiple Product Categories** | Research everything from electronics and household appliances to travel gear and automotive parts. |

## 💡 How It Works (Your Research in 3 Steps)

1.  **Input Criteria:** The user types their detailed request into the search bar (e.g., "Best noise-cancelling over-ear headphones for running, priced under $250, with a waterproof rating of IPX5 or higher").
2.  **AI Research:** Spender Buddy's search module instantly executes a deep web search, focusing on specification sheets, verified reviews, and official retailer data.
3.  **Output & Verification:** The AI compiles the findings, eliminating products that fail even one criteria. It then presents the top recommendations with a clear justification and a set of numbered source links (e.g., [1], [2], [3]) for full transparency.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack (Conceptual)

*   **Core AI Engine:** A powerful Large Language Model (LLM) capable of complex reasoning, information synthesis, and **Internet-augmented search**.
*   **Search Infrastructure:** Integration with robust web crawling and indexing APIs (or custom search layer) to access real-time, relevant product data.
*   **Backend:** Python (or similar) for fast data processing, NLP, and LLM management.

## 🎯 Use Cases
